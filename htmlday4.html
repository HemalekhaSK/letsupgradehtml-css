    <h1 id="main heading">Nostradomus Predictions:</h1>
    <h2 id="headind one">The great fire of London!</h2>
    <p>It's tantalizing if you interpret,ads come do,twenty threes the six.Add to
        that the mention of London and references to deaths,you can see why it's beleived to be a prophecy
        of the Great Fire of London in 1666.
    </p>
    <h2 id="heading two">The death of Henry II!</h2>
    <p>The most invincible Henry King of France.Unfortunately,Henry actually turned out to be very vincible indeed
        and came to horribly painful end aged just 40.A passionate sportsman fond of hunting and jousting,
        Henry's active nature provided his undoing when,in the summer of 1559,he held a tournament to celebrate 
        a recent peace treayt.
    </p>
    <h2 id="heading three">The Hiroshima and Nagasaki!</h2>
    <p>Within two cities,Nostradamus wrote,three will be scourges the like of which was never
        seen.That description would certainly apply to what occured in the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and 
        Nagasaki,which were devastated by atomci bombs at the end of World War Two.
